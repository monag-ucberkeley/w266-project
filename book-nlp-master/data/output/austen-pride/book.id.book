The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family .

You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . '' ","i":38901},{"w":"`` My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances -LRB- like myself -RRB- to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion -LRB- unasked too ! -RRB- on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh 's footstool , that she said , ` Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own _ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I can assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father -LRB- who , however , may live many years longer -RRB- , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . '' ","i":39116},{"w":"`` I am not now to learn , '' ","i":39773},{"w":"`` that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . '' ","i":39794},{"w":"`` Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , '' ","i":39994},{"w":"`` but I can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again , I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualification . '' ","i":40012},{"w":"`` When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . '' ","i":40195},{"w":"`` You are uniformly charming ! '' ","i":40641},{"w":"`` and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . '' ","i":40658},{"w":"`` Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , '' ","i":41002},{"w":"`` but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity .

Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .

Our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly .

You must not disappoint your father . '' ","i":52986},{"w":"`` As I did the other day , '' ","i":53512},{"w":"`` very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be the wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . '' ","i":53528},{"w":"`` I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . '' ","i":53854},{"w":"`` but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall see them soon here . '' ","i":54345},{"w":"`` My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy -- your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there . -- Yours , etc. '' ","i":54585},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":56795},{"w":"`` have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish .

What are young men to rocks and mountains ? Oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarreling about its relative situation .

Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . '' ","i":59179},{"w":"`` No governess ! How was that possible ?

It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution .

But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance .

But , '' ","i":68230},{"w":"`` as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . '' ","i":68285},{"w":"`` In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I can not -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . '' ","i":69683},{"w":"`` I might as well inquire , '' ","i":69964},{"w":"`` why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my feelings decided against you -- had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? '' ","i":69975},{"w":"`` I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny , that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other -- of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . '' ","i":70120},{"w":"`` Can you deny that you have done it ? '' ","i":70252},{"w":"`` But it is not merely this affair , '' ","i":70341},{"w":"`` on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham .

But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? -- to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ?

Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other .

What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step -LRB- and let us rejoice over it -RRB- marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . '' ","i":99157},{"w":"`` Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? '' ","i":100310},{"w":"`` Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ?

But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half-year , nay , for a twelvemonth -- she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the -- shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . '' ","i":103212},{"w":"`` I do indeed , '' ","i":103547},{"w":"`` But you -- how are you ?
